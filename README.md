# RAG Chatbot

A simple **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** chatbot.  
Upload a document → Ask questions → Get answers grounded in your document.

## What is RAG?

RAG stands for **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**. It solves the problem of LLMs not knowing about *your* private documents.

Instead of relying on the LLM's training data, RAG:
1. **Splits** your document into small chunks
2. **Embeds** each chunk as a vector (a list of numbers representing meaning)
3. **Stores** all vectors in a vector store (FAISS)
4. When you ask a question, **finds the most similar chunks** using cosine similarity
5. **Sends** those chunks + your question to the LLM as context
6. The LLM **answers based only on the retrieved context** — not from memory

This means the LLM can only answer from your document, not hallucinate from training data.

## RAG Flow (step by step)

```
User uploads a file
       │
       ▼
Read text from file (PDF / DOCX / TXT)
       │
       ▼
Split into chunks (RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter)
  chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200
       │
       ▼
Embed each chunk (HuggingFace: sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
  → converts text to a 384-dimensional vector
  → free, runs locally, no API key needed
       │
       ▼
Store vectors in FAISS (in-memory vector store)
       │
       ▼
User asks a question
       │
       ▼
Embed the question (same embedding model)
       │
       ▼
Similarity search in FAISS → top 4 most relevant chunks
       │
       ▼
Build prompt: context (4 chunks) + question
       │
       ▼
Send to Groq LLM (llama-3.3-70b-versatile)
       │
       ▼
Return answer to user
```

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set your Groq API key
echo "GROQ_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env

# Start the server
uvicorn api.index:app --reload

# Open the UI
# Go to: http://localhost:8000
