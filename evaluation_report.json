      "question": "What problem does SEEBot solve for enterprise chatbots?",
      "answer": "SEEBot solves two major problems for enterprise chatbots:   1. Privacy concerns, as user data is often used for model training in traditional approaches. 2. High costs for enterprises, as they rely on external service providers.   SEEBot addresses these challenges by providing a secure and economical solution using open-source LLMs, allowing for on-premise deployment and ensuring full data privacy and security.",
